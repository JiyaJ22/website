To back up the scatter plots and box plots I did for sqft vs price, beds vs price, and bath vs price. + for heatmap


Pearson correlation coefficients showing how strongly each variable is related to price:

Square footage (sqft) vs price: 0.583 → Moderate positive correlation- strongest.

Bathrooms (bath) vs price: 0.478 → Moderate positive correlation

Bedrooms (bed) vs price: 0.349 → Weak to moderate positive correlation

Conclusion:
Square footage correlates most strongly with higher price.

Bathrooms are next.

Bedrooms have the weakest correlation to price out of the three.
